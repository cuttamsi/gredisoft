# Gredisoft Bot

A fun little web app that listens to a users voice and uses the text for a google search. In the future these voice commands could be used for semantic web searches (say by query of DBPedia or NELL). The bot could also use text to speech APIs to talk back to the user. 

Works best with Google Chrome.
